If we were more experienced programmers, our project would extend the "family and styles" lists:
	For each font:
		-Test first word, and compare it to the first word of the next font
			-If the first words are different, the first word of the first font is its own family.
			-If the first words are the same, test the second word of the first font and the second word of the second font. 
				-Continue testing the fonts this way until the corresponding words to do not match, all the words that do match constitute the family, the left over words constitute the style

	We would create a 2D array:
		array[0] would be the family
		array[1] would be a list of all the styles that begin with the family

	Taking this one step further, our output panels would become dynamically linked so that when a font family (array[0]) was clicked, the styles would be updated to display the corresponding styles (array[1])
